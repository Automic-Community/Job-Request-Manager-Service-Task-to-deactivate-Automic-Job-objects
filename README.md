Documenation and Instructions
---

<p><span>It is not unusual that (business) users wanted to have a periodically scheduled Job or Workflow de-/activated for short period of time.<span>&nbsp; </span>The day planning should not be modified since this is just a temporary necessity.</span></p>
<p><span>The Service Task enables you to build a Job Request Management Service which allows users to create a request to de-/activate an Automic Job for short period of time. No manual interactions required, because this Service Task de-/activates the Automic object directly.</span></p>
<p><span>Such Service Task helps to reduce the number of emails or phone calls from users with the request to deactivate Job A for X days.</span></p>
